# albumartgenerator

This is a dumb website that allows you to upload a photo, choose a color for your font,
and then render album title style layouts. Then you can right click on the image to save.  

Because canvas font is really bad, it's not that forgiving for very long strings etc.  

This is largely lacking in error checking.  I feel that in order to make redrawing the fonts more graceful, I would have to use the dom.  

Inspired by one of my fave record company's designs.  

Put this on your website, see if I care!
