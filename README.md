# albumartgenerator

This is a dumb website that allows you to upload a photo, choose a color for your font,
and then render album title style layouts. 

Because canvas font is really bad, it's not that forgiving for very long strings etc.  

Inspired by one of my fave record company's designs.  

Put this on your website, see if I care! 

Uses [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) (sort of) and [color thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief)
